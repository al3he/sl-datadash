"Notes"
"The 2010 Affordable Care Act expands Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level (about $18,754 for an individual in 2022). However, the Supreme Court ruling issued in 2012 made the decision whether to expand Medicaid optional for states. As of December 2023, 41 states (including DC) were moving forward with the Medicaid expansion. In states that do not expand Medicaid, poor uninsured adults with incomes above current Medicaid eligibility levels but below poverty may fall into a ""coverage gap"" of earning too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits. These data exclude undocumented immigrants and legal immigrants who have been in the US for <5 years."
